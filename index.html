            <h1><a id="linz" class="anchor" href="#linz" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Linz</h1>

            <p>Welcome to Linz. A CMS of another kind.</p>
            <p>Linz is not quite a CMS, but a powerful framework for creating administration interfaces. Linz is the framework of choice when the administration interface is the website itself.</p>
            <p>If you're looking for a CMS, try something else like <a href="http://keystonejs.com/">KeystoneJS</a>. If you're looking for a highly customisable administration interface, that is also a treat to use, then you're in the right place.</p>

            <h2><a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

            <h3><a id="express-and-mongodb" class="anchor" href="#express-and-mongodb" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Express and MongoDB</h3>

            <p>Linz is backed with Express and MongoDB. If you're familiar with these projects, then you'll feel at home using Linz. Linz has been designed to keep out of the way unless you need it.</p>

            <h3><a id="auto-generated-ui" class="anchor" href="#auto-generated-ui" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Auto-generated UI</h3>

            <p>Linz provides powerful DSLs to express database models and custom administration interfaces. These DSLs are turned into beautiful HTML, JavaScript and CSS to make it quick and easy to manage your data. If you don't like the default output, use an override to customise it.</p>

            <h3><a id="only-when-you-need-it" class="anchor" href="#only-when-you-need-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Only when you need it</h3>

            <p>You can integrate as little, or as much of Linz as you like. Linz has purposely been designed so that you don't have to rework your entire codebase to get started.</p>

            <h2><a id="get-started" class="anchor" href="#get-started" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Get started</h2>

            <p>To get started with Linz, we recommend you read the getting started guide. This will get you up and running with Linz in no time.</p>
            <p>This documentation website is a work in progress. There are many more features in Linz than you'll find documented here at the moment. If you're happy to read code, then hop to it and start using all the undocumented goodness. If you'd like to help with documentation, that'd be great, create a pull request to help make developing with Linz better.</p>

            <h2><a id="get-started-with-development" class="anchor" href="#get-started-with-development" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Get started with development</h2>
