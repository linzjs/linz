*************
API
*************

Linz contains many useful APIs to simplify development.

At present, we're working on a long term effort to expose all of Linz's functionality via APIs and have Linz use these APIs itself. This will provide the most flexibility to customise Linz, without having to do the heavy lifting yourself when choosing to change something about Linz.

You can access the Linz APIs via ``linz.api``.

Session
=======

The methods exposed via the ``linz.api.session`` namespace have functionality centered around working with the user session.

session.getTimezone(req)
------------------------

Get the timezone offset of the current user.

Views
=====

The methods exposed via the ``linz.api.views`` namespace have functionality centered around working with Linz's views.

You can use these methods to render your own content, within a Linz template.

views.getScripts(req, res, scripts = [])
----------------------------------------

Get the scripts that Linz uses for a particular route.

views.getStyles(req, res, scripts = [])
---------------------------------------

Get the styles that Linz uses for a particular route.

.. _api-reference-views-notification:

views.notification(noty)
------------------------

Takes an object, and applies noty defaults to it, making it easy to create noty objects for notifications. You can ready more about `Noty options`_.

.. _Noty options: https://ned.im/noty/#/options

views.render(options, callback)
-------------------------------

Render some HTML, within a Linz template. Useful for developing completely custom page content, without having to provide the Linz basics such as navigation, log out controls, etc.

Parameters:
~~~~~~~~~~~

options: object
+++++++++++++++

``options`` object is used to pass the HTML that should be rendered within the Linz template. The following table describes the properties of the ``options`` object.

================== ====== =============
Property           Type   Description
================== ====== =============
``header``         HTML   This is the header of the page. You'll need to include wrapping div elements in your HTML to make it look like the default.
``body``           HTML   This is the body of the page. You'll need to include wrapping div elements in your HTML to make it look like the default.
``page``           HTML   If provided, header and body are ignored, allowing completely custom content.
``script``         HTML   This is intended to be ``<script>`` tags placed at the bottom (just above ``</body>``).
``template``       String Either ``wrapper`` or ``wrapper-preauth``. This is the template to use to wrap the provided HTML. Defaults to ``layout``.
================== ====== =============

callback
++++++++

``callback`` can be one of two things:

- A standard callback ``function`` in the format ``callback(err, html)``.
- An Express response (``res``) object.

If an Express reponse object is provided, Linz will automatically call ``res.render`` with the rendered HTML.

Example
~~~~~~~

.. code:: JavaScript

  const linz = require('linz');

  module.exports = function (req, res, next) {

    const locals = {
      header: '<div class="col-xs-12"><div class="model-title"><h1>Header.</h1></div></div>',
      body: '<div class="container linz-container index"><div class="col-xs-12"><p>Body.</p></div></div>'
    };

    linz.api.views.render(locals, req, res, (err, html) => {

      if (err) {
        return next(err);
      }

      return res.send(html);

    });

  };


views.viewPath(view)
--------------------

Returns the complete path to one of Linz's views.

Parameters:
~~~~~~~~~~~

view: string
++++++++++++

``view`` is a string that is the name of a view found within Linz's views directory.
