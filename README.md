An administration interface framework for Node.js.

Linz is not a CMS, but is capable of CMS like functionality. Linz is a good choice of framework when the administration interface _is_ the website _itself_.

Linz is in early stages of development. It's being used within a few production sites, but we're working on documentation and properly launching this as an open source project. You can [view progress here](https://github.com/linzjs/linz/issues/98).

## Documentation

We're in the middle of a major effort to update the documentation. You can read the documentation here https://linzjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ and for the latest bleeding edge version of the documentation, visit https://linzjs.readthedocs.io/en/doc-updates/
