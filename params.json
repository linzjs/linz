{"name":"Linz","tagline":"Node.js administration framework","body":"# Linz\r\n\r\nWelcome to Linz. A CMS of another kind.\r\n\r\nLinz is not quite a CMS, but a powerful framework for creating administration interfaces. Linz is the framework of choice when the administration interface is the website itself.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a CMS, try something else like [KeystoneJS](http://keystonejs.com/). If you're looking for a highly customisable administration interface, that is also a treat to use, then you're in the right place.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n### Express and MongoDB\r\nLinz is backed with Express and MongoDB. If you're familiar with these projects, then you'll feel at home using Linz. Linz has been designed to keep out of the way unless you need it.\r\n\r\n### Auto-generated UI\r\nLinz provides powerful DSLs to express database models and custom administration interfaces. These DSLs are turned into beautiful HTML, JavaScript and CSS to make it quick and easy to manage your data. If you don't like the default output, use an override to customise it.\r\n\r\n### Only when you need it\r\nYou can integrate as little, or as much of Linz as you like. Linz has purposely been designed so that you don't have to rework your entire codebase to get started.\r\n\r\n## Get started\r\n\r\nTo get started with Linz, we recommend you read the getting started guide. This will get you up and running with Linz in no time.\r\n\r\nThis documentation website is a work in progress. There are many more features in Linz than you'll find documented here at the moment. If you're happy to read code, then hop to it and start using all the undocumented goodness. If you'd like to help with documentation, that'd be great, create a pull request to help make developing with Linz better.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
